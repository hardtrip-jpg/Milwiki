    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The idea of a new stadium for the Milwaukee Brewers was first discussed in the early 1990s as the Brewers' former home, County Stadium, was aging. The need for a modern, multi-purpose venue became clear after the team’s success in the 1980s and the growing demand for a state-of-the-art facility. In 1996, the Wisconsin State Legislature approved funding for a new stadium, and construction of the new facility began in 1997.</p>

    <p>Originally known as <strong>Miller Park</strong>, the stadium was funded by a combination of public and private money, with a major sponsorship agreement with the Miller Brewing Company. The ballpark was officially opened on April 6, 2001, with a game between the Brewers and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>. The stadium features a retractable roof, allowing for games to continue regardless of weather conditions, a first for the city.</p>

    <h2>Renaming to American Family Field</h2>

    <p>In 2021, the Brewers announced a change in the stadium’s naming rights, with the naming agreement shifting from MillerCoors to American Family Insurance. The change was part of a new long-term partnership with American Family, which had been an official sponsor of the team for years. As a result, the stadium was renamed <strong>American Family Field</strong>, with the official unveiling taking place in 2021.</p>

    <h2>Design and Features</h2>

    <p>American Family Field features several key design elements that make it one of the most unique and fan-friendly stadiums in the MLB:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retractable Roof:</strong> The stadium is best known for its fully retractable roof, which can open or close in about 10 minutes. This feature ensures that games can continue in all weather conditions, making it one of the most climate-controlled venues in the major leagues.</li>
        <li><strong>Seating Capacity:</strong> The stadium has a seating capacity of 41,900 for baseball games, with additional space for concerts and other events.</li>
        <li><strong>Bernie's Chalet:</strong> One of the stadium's iconic features is the <em>Bernie's Chalet</em>, a large slide located in the outfield. When a Brewers player hits a home run, the team mascot, Bernie Brewer, slides down from a chalet in the outfield to celebrate with the fans.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailgate Village:</strong> The stadium features a dedicated Tailgate Village area where fans can enjoy tailgating activities before games, making it a popular spot for socializing and pre-game celebrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Brewers Hall of Fame:</strong> The stadium houses the Brewers Hall of Fame, which honors notable players and figures in the history of the Milwaukee Brewers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>In addition to being the home of the Milwaukee Brewers, American Family Field also hosts a variety of events throughout the year. These events include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Major League Baseball Games:</strong> As the home of the Brewers, American Family Field hosts regular-season MLB games, including divisional matchups, interleague games, and playoff games when the team qualifies.</li>
        <li><strong>Concerts:</strong> The stadium hosts major concerts, particularly during the summer months. Artists from various genres have performed at the stadium, attracting large crowds.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Events:</strong> The stadium is used for various community events, charity fundraisers, and local gatherings throughout the year, making it a central part of Milwaukee’s public life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility and Transportation</h2>

    <p>American Family Field is located just west of downtown Milwaukee, making it easily accessible to fans coming from both the city and the surrounding areas. The stadium is served by a network of public transportation options, including bus routes and nearby parking lots. Fans can also access the venue via major highways like Interstate 94 and Interstate 43. The stadium's location allows for ample parking, with several parking lots around the venue providing convenient access to the stadium before and after games.</p>

    <h2>Fan Experience</h2>

    <p>The fan experience at American Family Field is highly regarded, with a focus on comfort, entertainment, and accessibility. The retractable roof ensures that games are not affected by weather, and the stadium’s modern amenities offer fans a variety of food options, luxury suites, and interactive fan zones. The atmosphere in the stadium is lively and family-friendly, making it a popular destination for both casual fans and die-hard Brewers supporters.</p>

    <h2>Controversies</h2>

    <p>While American Family Field has generally been well-received, it has not been without controversy. One major point of discussion has been the use of public funds for the construction of the stadium, which has been a source of debate for many years. Critics argue that the public subsidy was too large, especially as the stadium’s naming rights were sold to a major corporation. However, proponents of the stadium emphasize the economic impact and the role it has played in revitalizing the local economy and supporting the Brewers franchise.</p>
