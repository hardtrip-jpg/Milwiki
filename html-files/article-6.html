    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The Milwaukee Art Museum was established in 1888 by a group of civic-minded Milwaukeeans. Initially, the museum's collection was housed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Public_Library">Milwaukee Public Library</a>, but as the collection grew, a dedicated space was needed. In 1957, the museum moved to its current location on the lakefront. The museum’s collection has continued to expand over the years, with a focus on European and American art, as well as contemporary pieces.</p>

    <p>The museum underwent significant renovations and expansions in the 21st century. One of the most notable developments was the opening of the <strong>Quadracci Pavilion</strong> in 2001, designed by architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a>. This addition transformed the museum’s identity, both architecturally and culturally, and solidified its place as one of the top architectural landmarks in Milwaukee. The pavilion features a distinctive <strong>brise soleil</strong>, a moveable, wing-like structure that opens and closes based on the time of day and weather conditions.</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>The Milwaukee Art Museum is renowned for its stunning architecture. The most iconic element is the <strong>Quadracci Pavilion</strong>, a modern addition to the museum designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The pavilion's most striking feature is its <em>Brise Soleil</em>, a series of large, moveable wings that extend outward, resembling the wings of a bird. These wings open and close depending on the time of day, creating a dynamic and ever-changing visual experience.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Quadracci Pavilion, the museum also includes the <strong>War Memorial Center</strong>, designed by architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>, which houses the museum's original galleries. The combination of these two architectural styles—modern and mid-century—creates a striking contrast and contributes to the museum’s aesthetic appeal.</p>
