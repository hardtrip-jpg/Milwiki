    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Milwaukee was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, particularly the <strong>Potawatomi</strong>, <strong>Ojibwe</strong>, and <strong>Menominee</strong> peoples.

    <p>Milwaukee grew rapidly during the 19th century due to its location along Lake Michigan and the development of its transportation network, including the Milwaukee River, which allowed for the transportation of goods.

    <p>The city became famous for its brewing industry, with iconic companies such as <strong>Pabst</strong>, <strong>Miller</strong>, and <strong>Schroeder's</strong> dominating the market.
